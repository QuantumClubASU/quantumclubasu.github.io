We’re kicking off the spring semester with an exciting guest talk by Monica Van Dieren from NVIDIA 🔥 

Monica will break down CUDA-Q, NVIDIA’s cutting-edge platform for hybrid quantum-classical computing. We’ll explore how CUDA-Q connects GPUs with quantum hardware, unlocks high-performance quantum workflows, and pushes quantum computing closer to real-world impact.
Find answers to questions like:
* Where quantum meets GPU acceleration
* How hybrid workflows actually scale
* Why CUDA-Q is a big deal for the future of quantum
